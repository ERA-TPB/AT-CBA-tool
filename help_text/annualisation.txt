### Annualisation factor

The annualisation factor converts daily demand estimates to annual demand to calculate net benefits. An appropriate annualisation factor should depend on the expected usage of the facility and how demand assumptions have been reached.

It is important that the annualisation factor and demand assumptions are aligned.

By default, demand is input for an average week, so the annualisation factor is 52.

If demand is a daily average, an annualisation factor of 365 would be appropriate.

If demand reflects high proportions of work, school and tertiary education trips, an annualisation factor that reflects the standard work or education year would be appropriate.

Where a facility features high proportions of recreational use, trips are more likely on weekends and public holidays and a lower annualisation factor would be suitable.

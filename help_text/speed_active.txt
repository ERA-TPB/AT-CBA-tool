### Average speeds for active modes

The average speed for active travel trips tends to vary based on facility type. For example, a cyclist on a dedicated bikeway is likely to have a higher average speed than a comparable cycling trip on a congested road with intersections.   
 
Average effective speed inputs are critical as changes in travel time are calculated through estimates of changes in speed. Projects that deliver new active travel infrastructure with a higher average effective speed compared to the infrastructure used in the base case will reduce travel times for active travellers.
 
Benefits are calculated for active travel trips based on reduced travel times using value of travel time unit values.

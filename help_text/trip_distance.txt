### Total trip distance

The average trip distance represents the average total trip distance for users of each mode - not just the component of the trip on the new facility.

Average trip distances tend to vary by mode and trip purpose and may differ depending on the location and nature of a project. For example, walking trip distances tend to be similar across trip purposes, whereas cycling trip distances may vary considerably with work trips typically longer than non-work trips.

Trip distances are used to calculate net benefits for new active travel trips. This includes health benefits based on the average length of a new walking or cycling trip or environmental and decongestion benefits based on the reduction in vehicle kilometres from those switching from cars.

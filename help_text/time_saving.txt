### Change in travel time

This section allows practitioners to incorporate travel time savings not arising out of a reduction in trip distance or increased travel speed. 

This figure should be the average per trip (not per intersection treatment).

For new active travel infrastructure, travel time savings will mostly result from users switching to a new facility with a higher average speed and/or a reduction in the distance travelled as a result of the project.  Distinct travel time savings are only likely to be relevant for specific projects that reduce delays for active travellers but do not result in a change in infrastructure type. For example, a bridge or underpass that reduces delays at an intersection but does not result in a change in distance or travel speed. A positive change represents a travel time saving and will be calculated as a benefit based on the value of travel time unit values.

### Parking costs

New active travel trips that switched from cars in the base case are likely to save on parking costs. Work trips and some education trips to inner-city areas are the trips for which parking benefits are most likely.  

Reduced parking costs are calculated for new active travel trips that diverted from cars based on trip length and the per kilometre unit value.

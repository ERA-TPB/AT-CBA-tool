### Discount rate

Discounting allows for decisions to be made today about initiatives that have costs and benefits in the future. It is necessary because a dollar of benefit in the future is worth less than a dollar of benefit today. 

Discounting future financial and economic benefits and costs of a project is used to derive key indicators such as net present value or benefit cost ratio. 

There is a variety of views and approaches to selecting an appropriate social discount rate. In practice, it is typical to use the discount rate nominated by the funding jurisdiction. 

Currently Infrastructure Australia guidance specifies a 7 per cent real discount rate with 4 per cent and 10 per cent used for sensitivity testing. Discount rate sensitivity testing can be done in the Sensitivity testing section of this tool.

### Cost of congestion

When Motor vehicle trips shift to active travel, other motorists who continue to use the road network face less traffic congestion, and thus gain a benefit. Congestion costs vary depending on the time of day the trip is made and the location of the trip.   

Decongestion benefits are estimated for new active travel trips that switch from cars in the base case using per kilometre unit values and estimated diversion congestion rates.

### Health system costs

The physical activity associated with active travel reduces the the burden on health systems because active travellers tend to be healthier. 

Health system benefits are calculated for new active travel trips based on trip length and the per kilometre unit value.

The default health system benefits for e-bikes are based on ATAP guidance for bicycles. By default it is assumed there are no health benefits to e-scooters.

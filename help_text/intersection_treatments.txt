### Intersection treatments

Use this section to include safety improvements for any intersection treatments as part of the project.

This is calculated by taking the expected number of fatalities and injuries in the base case, multiplying them each by a cost parameter, then reducing this cost by the input risk reduction factor.

Note that safety improvements from moving trips between surface types (e.g. from on-road to an on-road bikelane) will already be calculated. This section is for additional safety benefits from altering an intersection with known risks of injury or death.

See: [ATAP M4 5.5.2](https://www.atap.gov.au/mode-specific-guidance/active-travel/5-estimation-of-benefits) for a guide to the effectiveness of intersection treatments.
